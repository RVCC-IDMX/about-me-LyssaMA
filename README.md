<!-- Site Description-->

# Logo
I will be using this in a lot of sites I build since most will have some sort of representation for the business it coincides with. I learned how to import an image by dropping it into an img folder, how to copy the relative path so it appears correclty, how to name it appropriately, and adjust the position and size which was definetly helpful.
# Navigation bar
Very useful skill to learn! I imagine each site will need some sort of navigation so learing how to create different options that lead straight to each section was very hepful. I used what I had learned about adding a list in order to create the different options to choose from in the nav bar. Adding the ability to scroll and seeing how much variety there is was great. I also learned how to add hover effects which gives the overall look an extra nice feature. I struggled with this a bit, but after learing about invert, things became clear and now I know I can utilize that feature or leave it out.
# Biography
This section was fairly simple to create. I learned how to create a div, label it so it's easily identifiable, and add a child so the section could have a title, add a p tag so there could be a paragraph under the title. This was usesful so everything isn't in one section and can be seperated. I had no idea how to build anything when I started so this was very helpful! I also learned how to change the font family and size in css.
# Hobbies
In additon to using the list, I learned how to add some style to them. Bullet points, adding a border, changing the look of the border like rounding the edged, color change, adding margins, padding, displaying flex boxes and direction of columns, and alignment of text. There was a lot of useful skills in this one section alone.
# Gallery
I learned that in order to get images to appear they must be in the same folder. Choosing a name such as img helped identify where my photos were. I applied some of what I learned about adding borders and hover effect to make them look better. I also learned how to add figcaptions so the viewer can see an explanation of what the image is.
# Literature 
For this section, I learned to make text appear in different columns. I played around with differnt options to create rows as well. I also learned how to add a drop cap in a paragraph by targeting a certain letter within a child to add some style. Also, how to make it more visually appealing by adjusting shadows and color.
# Website 
Adding a website URL was a great skill because sharing a hyperlink leading to another site is popular when it comes to websites. Often, there is additional information to share or reference, so having the knowledge to do so is helpful. 
# Video
In this section I learned how to embed a video from YouTube by making sure to copy the correct path using the embed code to copy and paste into my code. This copied the iframe and URL so that the video appears in my website. I will definitely use this skill, it's great for showing examples or showcasing work.
# Contact
This was pretty fun to work on and I am happy to have this knowledge! I learned to create a contact form that accepts people's in
