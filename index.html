            <!--This is my bio -->
            <div>
                <p>I want to create and run my own website for my business, as well as design websites for other
                    respected people and/or companies. I am a licensed barber who loves cutting hair and maintaining
                    locs. I plan to continue barbering when I get my web developmet degree, but as a side gig. I love
                    making people feel empowered and more confident because when you look good, you feel good, and when
                    you feel good, you do good. Anything creative and unconventional is my go to, whether it's creating
                    original clothing templates, writing, painting, candle making, drumstick workouts, and spending time
                    with animals. </p>
                <p>Spending time outdoors is something I also really love. I enljoy taking walks, and going for a
                    hike. I am open-minded, inqusitive, and resilient. On my tough days, I am withdrawn and
                    disconnected. I am eager to learn how to code and create some interesting and amazing websites! </p>

            <h2>An Excerpt From Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>
            <div id="lit">
                <p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>ix o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently
                    near to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it
                    had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather
                    enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr.
                    Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures...</p>

                <p>From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the
                    morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the
                    face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer
                    was to be found on his chosen post.</p>

                <p>“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”</p>

                <p>And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as
                    clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and
                    shadow. By ten o’clock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of
                    the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out
                    of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of
                    any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he
                    was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long
                    grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still
                    a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his
                    attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong,
                    superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.</p>
