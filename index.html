            <!--This is my bio -->
            <div>
                <p>I want to create and run my own website for my business, as well as design websites for other
                    respected people and/or companies. I also want to continue barbering, but on the side when I'm not
                    cutting hair or maintaining locs. Anything creative and unconventional is my go to. </p>
                <p>Spending time outdoors is something I really love, wether it's taking a walk, or going for a hike. I
                    also love spending time at home creating art like painting, drawing, candle-making, creating
                    clothing templates, and writing poetry. I am open-minded, inqusitive, and resilient.
                    On my tough days I am withdrawn and disconnected. I am eager to learn how to code and create some
                    interesting and amazing things! </p>

            <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>
            <div id="lit">
                <p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>ix o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently
                    near to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it
                    had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather
                    enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr.
                    Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures...</p>

                <p>From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the
                    morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the
                    face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer
                    was to be found on his chosen post.</p>

                <p>“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”</p>

                <p>And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as
                    clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and
                    shadow. By ten o’clock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of
                    the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out
                    of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of
                    any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he
                    was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long
                    grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still
                    a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his
                    attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong,
                    superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.</p>
