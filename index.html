                <h2>Biography:</h2>
                <p> ¡Hola a todos! (Hello everyone!) Who is Lyssa? That's a complex question, I have so many layers and
                    who I am has so many variabes. Let me give you the basics and hopefully this page can help put
                    together more detail. I am a resilient, passionate, deep thinker, always willing to explore new
                    ideas. I love spending time outdoors, and I love animals! I am a writer and poet with an endless
                    love for language. I am currently taking classes at Raritan Valley Commuity College because I want
                    to create and run my own website for my online clothing business called True Poet Apparel, which
                    integrates poetry with fashion while also using original images. My goal is to also design websites
                    for other people and/or companies. So many are in need of websites and I would love to incorporate
                    my creativity and help bring others vision to life. I am a very detailed individual, and believe my
                    ability and desire to understand and be thorough will assist in my goals.</p>

                <p> Currently, I am a licensed barber who loves cutting hair and maintaining people's locs. I have been
                    growing my own for almost 2 years. I plan to continue barbering when I get my web developmet
                    degree, just not full time. I love making people feel empowered and more confident because when you
                    look good, you feel good, and when you feel good, you do good. Anything creative is my go to,
                    whether it's creating the original clothing templates for True Poet, writing, painting, art
                    projects, candle making, poetry nights, amatuer photography, live sketching in Brooklyn, I'm all
                    in!. </p>

                <p> I am a black Amercian with Mexican-American heritage as well. I have an older sister and a younger
                    brother. Music is my therapy. I would describe myself as open-minded, inqusitive, and a bit
                    eccentric. I have learned to appreciate it though, after all, many of the greats could be described
                    as a bit quirky. Sometimes I get caught up in my own thoughts so I may seem a bit aloof, but I am
                    actually just thinking! On my tough days, I am withdrawn and disconnected. I am eager to learn how
                    to code and create some interesting and amazing websites! </p>

            <h2>Locking Down Secure Open Source Software (Summary)</h2>
            <div id="lit">
                <p><span class="drop-cap"></span>This article discusses an ongoing problem with code security, focusing
                    on Log4J, an open-source software code which purpose is recording activity of code that’s written in
                    Java. The major problem being malware being inserted into programs used by a variety of companies
                    like Apple, Amazon, Web Services, video games, health departments, sheriff’s departments, Suffolk
                    County, NY, clerk’s office and other government agencies. Passwords and files were stolen, and
                    malicious code was added to the original program. Files were also encrypted by attackers in an
                    attempt to obtain $2.5 million from the county to regain control, which was refused. Instead, they
                    spent over double that amount to investigate and begin repairing the damage that was done. This was
                    not an easy task, projected to take years, since the program rated at the highest risk level of 10.
                    The malware was not easily caught because there wasn’t a pattern to it. It was not the product of a
                    bad code. Features which are added to codes can be used in a harmful manner, which is how Log4J
                    developed these issues. Because of this, it is tough to have software scan for these weaknesses.</p>

                <p>The idea of introducing hybrid Artificial Intelligence through a project called Social Cyber, was
                    suggested by DARPA, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. This would in hopes help
                    discover human behavior during the writing of the code, as well as the code itself. The purpose of
                    this project being to put together a database of information which would assist in research
                    development toward a solution of the infiltration. Another variable in the attack discussed was the
                    fact that program developers who don’t have much experience could knowingly, or unknowingly be
                    allowing problems into the code. This outcome is even more likely with a large volume of work. One
                    of the most problematic realities of attacks on open-source software, as well as software in
                    general, is a wide range of added plugins which are easily found and marketed though searches on
                    Google because they are ranked highly. This is detrimental because it doesn’t allow a pattern to
                    form which makes tracking the problem very difficult since it is always changing. Since this issue
                    applies to software in general and not only specific to open source, the office of management and
                    budget requires software providers to meet criteria that follows the National Institute of Standards
                    and Technology. The goal is not to make the safety of software absolute, that’s not exactly
                    possible, instead, it is to ensure good practices are being followed, and minimizing program
                    weaknesses. By coming up with a scale that would define the risk level, there is hope to gain more
                    control over the exposure of these vulnerabilities.  </p>
