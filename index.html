<section><!--This is my bio -->
<div>
    <p>I want to create and run my own website for my business, as well as design websites for other people and/or companies. I also want to continue barbering, but on the side when I'm not cutting hair or maintaining locs. Anything creative and unconventional is my go to. </p>
    <p>Spending time outdoors is something I really love, wether it's taking a walk, or going for a hike. I also love spending time at home creating art like painting, drawing, making candles, creating clothing templates, and writing.</p>
