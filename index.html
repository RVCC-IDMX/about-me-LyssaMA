    <!--This is my bio -->
<div>
    <p>I want to create and run my own website for my business, as well as design websites for other respected people and/or companies. I also want to continue barbering, but on the side when I'm not cutting hair or maintaining locs. Anything creative and unconventional is my go to. </p>
    <p>Spending time outdoors is something I really love, wether it's taking a walk, or going for a hike. I also love spending time at home creating art like painting, drawing, candle-making, creating clothing templates, and writing poetry.  I am open-minded, inqusitive, and resilient. 
        On my tough days I am withdrawn and disconnected. I am eager to learn how to code and create some interesting and amazing things! </p>
